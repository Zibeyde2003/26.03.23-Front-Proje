        <p>The company is founded by Anna and Michael Hofer, who have a keen interest in children’s fashion. <br> Their aim is to provide the best possible shopping experience for children and their parents and to <br> support the companies that do. Anna and Michael are passionate about children’s fashion and the <br> role it plays in the lives of children. They believe that children can never grow up without fashion, <br> and that fashion should always be available for them.</p>
        <p> We love children’s clothing. We believe that every child should have a wonderful wardrobe filled <br> with clothes that will make them feel good. We love that children love clothes, <br> that they want to look good and that they want to be in good clothes. We have created a fashion website where parents <br> can find their children’s clothing, so they can take care of their children’s clothing and <br> enjoy the good times.'</p>
